# Walker Lab Python Project Template
This is a GitHub template to kickstart a standard Python project.
The template project comes with the following (nearly) configured:
* Project packaging (`project` toplevel package and `setup.py`)
* Docker-based local running setup (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`)
* VSCode DevContainer configuration
* `.env` file template

Be sure to change the necessary placeholder names with your project-specific names.
